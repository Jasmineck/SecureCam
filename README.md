# SecureCam
A simple security camera application that uses the OpenCV library to capture video from a webcam and detect motion in the video feed. When motion is detected it produces a beep sound as an alert !! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

# Key Features:

Motion Detection: Our application constantly analyzes video input from a webcam, identifying any movement within its field of view.<br />

Object Highlighting: When motion is detected, the system dynamically outlines moving objects with green rectangles, visually representing the areas of interest.<br />

Alerting Mechanism: To ensure prompt attention, the system triggers a distinctive beep alert, making it immediately apparent when motion is detected.<br />

# Technological Components:

OpenCV: We harness the power of OpenCV, a widely-used computer vision library, to process video frames, detect motion, and apply visual enhancements.<br />

Python: The project is entirely implemented in Python, a versatile and widely adopted programming language.<br />
