# Python Security Camera Application

## Overview

The Python Security Camera Application is a surveillance system designed to detect motion using a webcam and alert users in real-time. This project leverages the power of the OpenCV library and is implemented entirely in Python. It provides a user-friendly way to monitor your surroundings and serves as an educational resource for exploring computer vision concepts.

## Key Features

- **Motion Detection:** The application continuously analyzes video input from a webcam, identifying any movement within its field of view.

- **Object Highlighting:** When motion is detected, the system dynamically outlines moving objects with green rectangles, visually representing the areas of interest.

- **Alerting Mechanism:** To ensure immediate attention, the system triggers a distinctive beep alert, making it immediately apparent when motion is detected.

## Technological Components

Before using this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.0
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- Winsound library (for the alerting mechanism)

## Use Cases:

- **Home Security**: Our application can serve as a cost-effective home security solution, providing homeowners with real-time monitoring and alerts.

- **Surveillance Systems**: In a professional setting, this technology can be integrated into existing surveillance systems to enhance motion detection capabilities.

You can install OpenCV and Winsound using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless
