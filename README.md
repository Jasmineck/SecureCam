# SecureCam
A simple security camera application that uses the OpenCV library to capture video from a webcam and detect motion in the video feed. When motion is detected it produces a beep sound as an alert !! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

## Key Features:

### Motion Detection
This application constantly analyzes video input from a webcam, identifying any movement within its field of view.<br />

### Object Highlighting
When motion is detected, the system dynamically outlines moving objects with green rectangles, visually representing the areas of interest.<br />

### Alerting Mechanism
To ensure prompt attention, the system triggers a distinctive beep alert, making it immediately apparent when motion is detected.<br />

## Technological Components:

### OpenCV
OpenCV, a widely used computer vision library, used to process video frames, detect motion, and apply visual enhancements.<br />

### Python
The project is entirely implemented in Python, a versatile and widely adopted programming language.<br />
